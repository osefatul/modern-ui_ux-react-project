### Navabar

- We have used navbarMenu and toggleMenu in order to determine our app work for mobile page as well.
- using > in css means directly under the parent class name. The css change will affect only when the child classname in under the parent classname at that time. it doesn't bring changes if the child is a refrenced component. in that case to bring changed in to the child component we have to use space:
  .parentClassName childClassname/htmlTag.
